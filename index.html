  <p>I had a very difficult time trying to figure out what to do this project on. Most UI's that I use don't need much improvement (or at least I think so hence why I use them).</p>
  <p>Eventually I decided to do this project on a site called horriblesubs.info; Horriblesubs is a fansub group that translates and subtitles unliscensed TV shows from Japan, Korea, and China into English, so westerners can watch the shows.</p>
  <p>The site is not very school appropriate so I wouldn't recommend visiting, but the UI problem is legitimate, and what's more is I am pretty sure I can implement a better solution.</p>
  <p>Previously on the site users could navigate to the main directory (figure 1.) click on a show they wanted and a drop down would show with download options for the episode (figure 3).</p>
  <p>However, around a year ago they switched it so that when you click on a show in figure 1, you are taken to a second page (figure 2) which has the drop down options for downloads.</p>
  <p>For this project I want to recreate the drop down functionality on the index page (figure 1.)</p>

  <h3>Figure 1.</h3>
  <p>The index page, previously users could view an episode's info and download options all from this page (in a dropdown).</p>

  <div class="flex-item">
  <h3>Figure 2.</h3>
  <p>This is the page users are directed to when clicking on an episode in figure 1. Not shown are all the advertisements posted around the edges of the actual content (the reason they implemented this inefficient UI in the first place I'd imagine.)</p>

  <div class="flex-item">
  <h3>Figure 3.</h3>
  <p>The actual content. This is the functionality I am going to be trying to replicate. Clicking on an element and receiving a dropdown menu with available download options.</p>
